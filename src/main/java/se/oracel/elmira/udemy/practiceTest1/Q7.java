//How many objects of Pen class are eligible for Garbage Collection at Line 4?  answer 2
/*
Explanation
Object created at Line 1 becomes eligible for Garbage collection after Line 1 only, as there are no references to it. So We have one object marked for GC.

Object created at Line 6 becomes unreachable after change(Pen) method pops out of the STACK, and this happens after Line 3.

So at Line 4, we have two Pen objects eligible for Garbage collection: Created at Line 1 and Created at Line 6.
